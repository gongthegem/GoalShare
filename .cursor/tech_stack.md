Based on the GoalFlow PRD, here's the optimal tech stack that aligns with its core requirements:

## Mobile Development

**React Native with Expo** is the ideal choice for GoalFlow because:
- **Cross-platform efficiency**: Single codebase for iOS and Android with native performance
- **Offline-first capabilities**: Excellent support for local storage and sync patterns
- **Real-time features**: Perfect for the daily deadline system and live draft updates
- **Community**: Large ecosystem for adding features like push notifications and analytics

## Backend Architecture

**Serverless-first approach** using:
- **Supabase** or **Firebase** for the backend-as-a-service
  - Real-time database for live draft syncing
  - Built-in authentication
  - Row-level security for privacy controls
  - File storage for potential media features

**Key services needed:**
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase) or Firestore (Firebase)
- **Authentication**: Built-in auth with social logins
- **Real-time sync**: WebSocket connections for live updates
- **Push notifications**: FCM/APNs integration
- **File storage**: For potential image/media uploads

## Database Design

**Hybrid approach** combining:
- **Local-first**: SQLite with Watermelon DB for offline functionality
- **Cloud sync**: Automatic background sync when online
- **Conflict resolution**: Last-write-wins with timestamp-based merging

## Key Technical Components

### Offline-First Architecture
```
Local Storage (SQLite) ↔ Sync Layer ↔ Cloud Database
```
- All operations work offline
- Background sync when connected
- Conflict resolution for multi-device usage

### Real-Time Systems
- **WebSocket connections** for live draft updates
- **Timezone handling** with date-fns or moment-timezone
- **Cron jobs** for automated daily submissions at 23:59

### Data Privacy & Security
- **End-to-end encryption** for sensitive journal entries
- **Granular permissions** for social sharing
- **GDPR compliance** with easy data export/deletion

## Recommended Tech Stack Summary

**Frontend:**
- React Native + Expo
- TypeScript for type safety
- React Query for server state management
- Zustand for client state management
- React Navigation for routing

**Backend:**
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + real-time + auth)
- Edge Functions for server-side logic
- Vercel/Netlify for any web dashboard

**Database:**
- Watermelon DB (local SQLite wrapper)
- Supabase PostgreSQL (cloud)
- Redis for caching and session management

**DevOps:**
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Sentry for error monitoring
- Mixpanel or PostHog for analytics
- TestFlight/Play Console for beta testing

**Third-party integrations:**
- Expo Notifications for push notifications
- react-native-keychain for secure storage
- date-fns for timezone/date handling

This stack prioritizes the app's core philosophy of being gentle, reliable, and privacy-focused while supporting the unique daily deadline system and optional social features. The offline-first approach ensures users can always "show up" regardless of connectivity, which is crucial for maintaining the supportive user experience.
