## Branch Strategy
- `main` - Stable, working code only
- `develop` - Integration branch for completed features
- Feature branches: `feature/[task-number]-[short-description]`
- Bugfix branches: `bugfix/[issue-number]-[short-description]`

## Commit Guidelines
1. Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
2. Use descriptive commit messages with task numbers:
   - Format: `[Task-XX] Brief description of changes`
   - Example: `[Task-27] Implement sentence parsing logic`
3. Include detailed body for complex changes
4. Reference task numbers in commit messages

## Integration Process
1. Complete feature in feature branch
2. Run tests locally before pushing
3. Push feature branch and create PR to develop
4. After review, merge to develop
5. Periodically merge develop into main when features are stable
